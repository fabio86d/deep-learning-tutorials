        "\n",
        "... and [many other things](http://setosa.io/ev/image-kernels/). You can think of a convolution as sliding a window, also called _kernel_ or _filter_, over each pixel of an image and computing a dot product between the filter's values and the image's values that the filter is covering. This operation produces one output value for every location on the image over which we slide the filter. Usually, we go through every pixel in the image and position the filter such that its center pixel lies on the image pixel. Hence, for pixels lying on the boundary of the image, we have to pad the image as the filter otherwise \"spills over\" (more on this later). A visualization of the convolution process looks like this (this and subsequent animations taken from [here](https://github.com/vdumoulin/conv_arithmetic)):\n",

        "In the context of CNNs, we are using exactly the same convolution operation, but we think of it in a slightly different way: Instead of producing a desired output image like in traditional image processing tasks (e.g. blurry, edges highlighted, etc.), a filter extracts certain _features_ from a local neighborhood and we store them in _feature maps_, sometimes also called _activation maps_ or simply _channels_. Moreover, we are moving several filters over a given image, so each convolutional layer potentially outputs several of those feature maps. Importantly, the weights of the filter are not fixed - those values are actually what the network must optimize. In other words, the network learns to set up those filters in such a way that they extract features from the images that are most useful for the network to solve the task at hand.\n",

        "### Types of Convolutions\n",
        "When adding a convolutional layer, we must decide upon the following:\n",
        "  - **Filter Size**: We have to decide how big a filter is, i.e. determine its width and height. Common choices are  small, square, and odd, e.g. 3-by-3, 5-by-5, 7-by-7, etc. Of course, this depends on the problem you are trying to solve. Increasing the filter sizes increases the amount of trainable parameters. CNNs are every effective models thanks to **weight-sharing** and **repetition of convolution operation**, which also provides invariance to certain image operations such as translation and rotation. The parameter space can be reduced considerably in comparison to fully connected layers. Choosing huge filter sizes goes against this intuition, and in recent research it was shown, that instead of increasing filter sizes, creating deeper models is generally a better idea.\n",
        "  - **Number of Feature Maps**: We should also decide how many feature maps each layer outputs. Again, this design choice depends on the problem.\n",
        "  - **Padding**: As mentioned above, when we apply the filter on the boundary of the image, the filter \"spills over\". Hence, we must decide what to do in these cases. TensorFlow knows two options: _VALID_ or _SAME_. When we choose _VALID_ the filter will only be placed on pixels where it does not \"spill over\" the boundary. This means, that the output image will _not_ have the same size as the input image. On the other hand _SAME_ applies just enough padding that the output image will be the same size as the input (if the stride is 1).\n",
        "  - **Strides**: So far we always assumed that once we computed the output of a filter at a given location, we just move on the pixel right next to it. We could however also choose to omit some pixels inbetween. E.g., if we were to compute the convolution only on every other pixel, we would say that we use a stride of 2. This effectively reduces the size of the output image. Sometimes strided convolutions are used instead of pooling layers. The following example shows a convolution with the stride set to 2 on both the vertical and the horizontal axis of the image.\n",
        "  <center><img src=\"https://imgur.com/kjgc33A.gif\" align=\"middle\" hspace=\"20px\" vspace=\"5px\"></center>\n",
        "  \n",
        "  - **Dilations**: In dilated convolutions, sometimes also called \"à trous\", we introduce holes in the filter, i.e. we spread the filter over a wider area but without considering some pixels inside that area in the computation of the dot product. This allows for a **faster growth of the receptive field** in deeper layers than with standard convolutions. The intuition behind is that it is easier to integrate global context into the convolution operation. The following example shows a dilated convolution with a dilation factor of 2 on both the vertical and horizontal axis of the image.\n",

        "### Building Blocks of a CNN\n",
        "CNNs built for classification tasks typically make use the following types of layers:\n",
        "  - **Convolutional Layers**: Layers implementing the actual convolution as explained above. Their outputs are feature maps which are then passed through an activation function in order to introduce non-linearities into the system. Convolutional layers can be seen as extracting features that are passed on deeper into the model thus enabling the model to learn higher-level features that maket he classification task easier.\n",
        "  - **Pooling Layers**: Downsampling or pooling layers concentrate the information so that deeper layers focus more on abstract/high-level patterns. You can apply strided convolutions to apply downsampling. A decreased image size also speeds up the processing time in general because less convolutions are necessary on subsequent layers. Furthermore, pooling allows for some translation invariance on the input. A common choice is max-pooling, where only the maximum value occurring in a certain region is propagated to the output.\n",
        "  - **Dense Layers**: A dense or fully-connected layer connects every node in the input to every node in the output. This is the type of layer you already used for the linear regression model in the previous tutorial. If the input dimension is large, the amount of learnable parameters introduced by using a dense layer can quickly explode. Hence, dense layers are usually added on deeper levels of the model, where the pooling operations have already reduced the dimensionality of the data. Typically, the dense layers are added last in a classification model, performing the actual classification on the features extracted by the convolutional layers.\n",

        "Note that we did not use an activation function on the output of the dense layer. Generally speaking, it is not always reasonable to use an activation function on the last layer, depending on the distribution of your outputs. For example, if you used a `tf.nn.tanh` activation on your output layer, all outputs would come to lie between -1 and 1. While an activation function on the outputs is a trick to define the output range for free, it is inherently biased. In other words, the distribution of output values does not match with the shape of the activation function. Depending on your problem, this might or might not make sense. \n",
        "\n",
        "For our case, we want the outputs of the model to be probabilities, i.e., the model should tell us what is the probability that a certain image belongs to each of the 10 classes. For this, we can use the softmax activation function, defined as follows:\n",

        "where $\\mathbf{z}$ is our $K$-dimensional output vector `logits` and $K$ refers to the number of classes that we are trying to predict, i.e. $K=10$ in our case. The softmax function essentially squashes its input between 0 and 1 and makes sure that all $K$ values sum up to 1. In other words, it produces a valid probability distribution over the number of classes.\n",

        "So, how come we did not supply `tf.nn.softmax` to our dense layer above? The reason is that when we feed softmax-activated values to our loss function, we introduce numerical instabilities that destabilize the training. The loss function measures how good the prediction of our network is. Ideally, if we feed an image depicting a hand-written 3 to our model, we want it to assign a probability of 1 to the class 3 and probabilities of 0 to all other classes. Thus, for every image we have a target distribution $q$, which is just a one-hot encoding of its label, and an estimated probability distribution $p$ which is the output of the model. A one-hot encoding of a label is simply a vector of zeros that has exactly one entry showing 1 corresponding to the index of that label. For example, the one-hot encoding of label 3 looks like this:\n",

You can see from this formula that if the predicted probability $p$ is exactly a one-hot encoding, $H(p, q)$ will be 0, because the entropy $H(p)$ of a one-hot vector is 0 and the KL divergence will also be 0 because $p$ exactly matches $q$.\n",
        "\n",
        "The problem with the cross-entropy, as mentioned before, is that it is numerically unstable and can produce `inf` values during training. Hence, TensorFlow produces a more stable version which takes as input the logits, _not_ the softmax activated values. This is why we did not choose an activation function for the outputs of the dense layer."

If you would observe that the validation accuracy is again going down after some time, while the training accuracy keeps improving, this would be a strong indication that the model is overfitting.\n",

If you see different behavior, e.g., no improvement at all over time, or no saturation phase, you might want to think about your choices for the learning rate, batch size, type of optimizer, or - in the worst case - the model architecture entirely. This is why it is beneficial to make certain parameteres configurable through the command line, so that you can quickly try different values for different hyper-parameters.\n",

        "In this tutorial you learned how to train and evaluate a simple convolutional neural network in TensorFlow for the task of hand-written digit classification and how to visualize certain statistics of the training process by using TensorBoard. You also learned which design choices are typically required to build a CNN (size of filters, size of filter maps, strides, pooling, etc.) and how you can plot results from intermediate layers in the architecture. We used a fairly low-level API of TensorFlow to build this model. We would also like to point you to the [`tf.layers`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/layers) or [`tf.keras`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras) API which has some more levels of abstraction. You are free to use any Tensorflow API in your projects. If you find the low-level API overwhelming, you may have a look this [`keras tutorial`](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials) implementing the same task with ridicilious amount of code compared to our tutorial."
